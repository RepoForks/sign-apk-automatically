# Sign APK automatically in Windows

Short batch script to sign an APK automatically. Just replace the paths to the different tools with those on your own system.

There are two files, one for signing a new app (will generate a new keystore) and one for an existing app (will use an existing keystore).

<strong>Start script in Administrator mode!!!</strong>
